Welcome to my first Unity game called "Cowboy Cat"!!

=== Objective ===
Avoid getting bitten by the mice and kill as many as possible!
Mice gradually lower your health, so try not to stick too close to them.

=== How to Play ===

A - to move left
S - to move down
D - to move right
(You can also use your arrow keys for movement)

Use your mouse cursor to aim the bullets.
left click to shoot your gun. 
(Hold the left click button to rapid fire)
